# Lighthouse-labs-Final-Project
The objective of this final project is to predict sales for the Top4Sport company on daily, weekly, and monthly basis. 
The Top4Sport company sells sports equipment in fifteen European countries, and its HQ is in Czech. The data I have used is the sales history of the company for the last 23 months, between June 2019 to May 7, 2021. I have received two datasets, Orders and Items, for this project. I have used machine learning models to predict daily, weekly, and monthly sales based on location and products of this company.
